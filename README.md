Changing eating habits and mitigating climate change: a carbon footprint
calculator and tracker for varying foods

With the effects of climate change becoming more prevalent, scientists and
engineers are trying to identify environmentally sustainable diets and create new
devices to mitigate this global problem. Although certain diets were identified as the
least detrimental to the environment, no impactful action was taken to change people’s
eating habits. This project influenced the participants’ selection of food items to be
more environmentally friendly by allowing them to calculate and log the carbon
emissions released for their individualized meals. Participants were asked to use the
application, programmed in Swift, to discover environmentally friendly meals and track
their food consumption. The users were also asked to complete a survey before and
after using the app to evaluate the effectiveness of the solution. Before distributing the
survey it was predicted that participants will have a change in awareness and carbon
emission impact after using the app. The paired T-tests performed on the datasets
helped compare their awareness and carbon emissions before and after introduced to
the treatment, which proved the prediction to be true. Based on the results, it can be
concluded that the iOS app was able to successfully increase participants’ awareness
and decrease their food’s carbon dioxide emissions. Therefore, this project reached its
goals of providing an option to mitigate climate change and introduce a tangible
solution to decrease people’s carbon footprint by helping enforce eco-friendly food
consumption.
